I am completing these challenges as I progress through the [Creat Machine Learning models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/create-machine-learn-models/) learning path on Microsoft Learn as part of the Microsoft Azure Data Science Associate certification. As a part of these challenges, I use Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data visualisation and developing regression, classification, clustering, neural networks and deep learning models.
